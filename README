=============

Sequential CPU implementations of MST-Solvers

Includes implementations for Boruvka's, Kruskal's and Prim's algorithms.

Requirements
=============

 * G++ 4.8 (or higher)
 * Boost 1.55.0 (or higher)

Usage
=============

See format.edges to check the expected input format. You can also choose your own graph source (e.g.: parse the file yourself, output of your function), as long as you map it to the CSR_Graph structure (more details on this tbc)

Run 

    make all

To compile all applications

Do not forget to include the lib folder into your library path!

   
Example input files can be found in the inputs folder. Larger input files can be downloaded from [here](http://www.alunos.di.uminho.pt/~pg22840/pub/inputs.tar.gz)

    bin/<application> <filename>
